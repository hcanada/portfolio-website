        I’m a Full-stack Developer with experience building reliable and user
        friendly web applications. I work across both frontend and backend
        systems to deliver solutions that are clean, efficient, and easy to
        maintain. <br />
        <br /> I focus on writing quality code, improving performance, and
        creating smooth user experiences. I enjoy turning complex requirements
        into simple, practical solutions and building applications that are
        scalable and well structured. I value clear communication, meeting
        deadlines, and understanding project goals to ensure the final product
        meets both technical and business needs.
        <br />
        <br />
        Outside of coding, I explore new technologies and follow web development
        trends. I also study crypto futures trading, focusing on risk management
        and discipline.
