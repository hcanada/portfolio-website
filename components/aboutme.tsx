        I’m a web developer who enjoys building clean and functional web
        applications. I’ve worked on real-world systems, including a Leave
        Management System used in a corporate environment. Currently, I focus on
        Next.js, Node.js (Express), and PostgreSQL while building and learning
        through projects.
        <br />
        <br />
        Outside of coding, I explore new technologies and follow web development
        trends. I also study crypto futures trading, focusing on risk management
        and discipline.
